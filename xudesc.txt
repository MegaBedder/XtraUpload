#summary The Best Online File Hosting Platform

== Introduction ==

Do you have a file hosting system on your site? Does it suck? Is it slowing your server to a standstill? Want a way out? Meet XtraUpload

== XtraUpload v1.6 ==

Written in PHP using a mysql backend, XtraUpload has all the features you would expect from a file Hosting Script. Free users as well as premium users have the ability to upload files but premium users get a lot more features such as viewing files, instantly downloading files and getting the URL's of the files they have uploaded. You can also specify the file types, sizes along with many other options. Each user must provide a valid email address when they sign up for premium as the script automatically sends the username and password to them upon reception of payment through PayPal IPN.
